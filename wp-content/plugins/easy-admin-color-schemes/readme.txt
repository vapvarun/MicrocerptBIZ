The Easy Admin Color Schemes plugin allows users to easily customize the colors of the administration interface for WordPress.

== Description ==

The Easy Admin Color Schemes plugin allows users to easily customize the colors of the administration interface for WordPress. It works by adding a new interface to the WordPress admin that allows you to add, edit, import, and export custom admin color schemes. Without the plugin you would need to know how to create your own WordPress plugins or customize WordPress code in order to add your own custom admin color schemes.

Get more information and support at [the official Easy Admin Color Schemes page](http://jamesdimick.com/easy-admin-color-schemes).

== Installation ==

Either [install the plugin automatically through WordPress](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins) or, follow these steps:

1. Extract all files from the ZIP archive, making sure to keep the file structure intact.
2. Upload the `easy-admin-color-schemes` folder to the WordPress plugins directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress.
4. Have fun creating new color schemes!
